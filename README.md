# Basic-Calculator
This program acts as a basic calculator, which promts user input through the console,
and prints the solution to the console. 

Rather than use the basic java library math functions, this program impliments linked lists
to perform calculations on large numbers with a lot of digits. It is tested on numbers up to
30 digits long, but can theoretically handle even larger numbers, although the runtime may increase.
